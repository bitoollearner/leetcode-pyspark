# LeetCode SQL Questions - PySpark Solutions-(BI Learner)
This repository is dedicated to solutions for LeetCode SQL questions implemented in PySpark.

This notebook contains a collection of SQL-related challenges sourced from **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**. The primary goal is to enhance SQL skills while leveraging **PySpark**, a powerful framework for large-scale data processing.

For each question, you will find:
- A brief problem description
- The relevant dataset or schema context
- A step-by-step solution implemented using PySpark DataFrames and SQL functions

### **Question Breakdown by Difficulty:**
| Difficulty | Count |
|------------|-------|
| Easy       | 111   |
| Medium     | 130   |
| Hard       | 60    |
| **Total**  | 301   |

All solutions in this notebook are implemented using **PySpark** to ensure consistency with big data processing practices. The approach utilizes **PySpark’s Python API, DataFrame API, and built-in functions** to solve problems efficiently.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> All questions and problem statements belong to **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**. This notebook is solely for educational purposes, and all credit and ownership of the questions remain with **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**. For any query reach out at **info.bilearner@gmail.com**.

## Prerequisites
- **Databricks Account:**
  - You need access to a Databricks account. Databricks provides a collaborative environment for big data analytics, including support for PySpark, which is crucial for running your solutions.
- **Basic Knowledge of PySpark:**
   - Familiarity with PySpark is essential. Users should understand how to write PySpark code to manipulate dataframes, perform transformations, and execute actions.
- **SQL Knowledge:**
   - Basic knowledge of SQL is required to understand and write SQL queries within the PySpark framework. This includes understanding SQL syntax, querying databases, and manipulating data.
- **GitHub Repository Access:**
   - Access to your GitHub repository containing solutions to LeetCode SQL questions. Users should be able to clone the repository, review the solutions, and potentially contribute if allowed.

### **Step 2: Create a Cluster**
1. Click on **Compute** in the left panel.
2. Click **Create Cluster**.
3. Name your cluster.
4. Choose the latest runtime version.
5. Click **Create Cluster** (Community Edition supports only small clusters).

### **Step 3: Create a Notebook**
1. Go to **Workspace > Users > Your Name**.
2. Click **Create > Notebook**.
3. Name the notebook and select **Python**.
4. Attach it to the running cluster.

## **Key Differences Between Premium and Community Edition**

| Feature | Databricks Premium | Databricks Community Edition |
