    "- For the second week of November 2023, there was a transaction on Friday, 2023-11-10, and it was made by a VIP member, amounting to $7,473. Since there were no purchases by Premium members that Friday, the output shows 0 for Premium members.\n",
    "- Similarly, during the third week of November 2023, no transactions by Premium or VIP members occurred on Friday, 2023-11-17, which shows 0 for both categories in this week.\n",
    "- In the fourth week of November 2023, transactions occurred on Friday, 2023-11-24, involving one Premium member purchase of $5,117 and VIP member purchases totaling $14,933 ($9,692 from one and $5,241 from another).\n",
