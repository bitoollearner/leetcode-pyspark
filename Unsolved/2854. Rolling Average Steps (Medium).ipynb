    "- For user id 1, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-06 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (395 + 499 + 712) / 3 = 535.33.\n",

    "- For user id 2, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-08 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (153 + 171 + 530) / 3 = 284.67.\n",
    "- For user id 3, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-09 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (120 + 557 + 840) / 3 = 505.67.\n",
    "- For user id 3, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-10 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (557 + 840 + 627) / 3 = 674.67.\n",
    "- For user id 4 and 5, the calculation of the rolling average is not viable as there is insufficient data for the consecutive three days. Output table ordered by user_id and steps_date in ascending order."
