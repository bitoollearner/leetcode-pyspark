    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Organization Structure:**\n",
    "- Alice (ID: 1) is the CEO (level 1) with no manager\n",
    "- Bob (ID: 2) and Charlie (ID: 3) report directly to Alice (level 2)\n",
    "- David (ID: 4), Eva (ID: 5) report to Bob, while Frank (ID: 6) and Grace (ID: 7) report to Charlie (level 3)\n",
    "- Hank (ID: 8) reports to David, and Ivy (ID: 9) and Judy (ID: 10) report to Frank (level 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level Calculation:**\n",
    "- The CEO (Alice) is at level 1\n",
    "- Each subsequent level of management adds 1 to the level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team Size Calculation:**\n",
    "- Alice has 9 employees under her (the entire company except herself)\n",
    "- Bob has 3 employees (David, Eva, and Hank)\n",
    "- Charlie has 4 employees (Frank, Grace, Ivy, and Judy)\n",
    "- David has 1 employee (Hank)\n",
    "- Frank has 2 employees (Ivy and Judy)\n",
    "- Eva, Grace, Hank, Ivy, and Judy have no direct reports (team_size = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Budget Calculation:**\n",
    "- Alice's budget: Her salary (12000) + all employees' salaries (72500) = 84500\n",
    "- Charlie's budget: His salary (10000) + Frank's budget (23000) + Grace's salary (8500) = 41500\n",
    "- Bob's budget: His salary (10000) + David's budget (13500) + Eva's salary (7500) = 31000\n",
    "- Frank's budget: His salary (9000) + Ivy's salary (7000) + Judy's salary (7000) = 23000\n",
    "- David's budget: His salary (7500) + Hank's salary (6000) = 13500\n",
    "- Employees with no direct reports have budgets equal to their own salary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- The result is ordered first by level in ascending order\n",
    "- Within the same level, employees are ordered by budget in descending order then by name in ascending order"
